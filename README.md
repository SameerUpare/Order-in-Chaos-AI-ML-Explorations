 # Order in Chaos: AI/ML Explorations 🚀

(https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameerupare/)

> A learning journal and code repository documenting a hands-on journey back into the world of coding, powered by modern AI/ML.


## 📖 About This Series

Hello! I'm a technology leader rediscovering the joy of hands-on coding after years in program management. This repository is the home for my weekly series, **"Order in Chaos,"** where I explore the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This journey is about:
*   **Rediscovery:** Rekindling the excitement of building I felt over two decades ago.
*   **Modern Tooling:** Leveraging LLMs (like ChatGPT and DeepSeek) to create a fluid, accelerated learning experience.
*   **Practical Application:** Moving beyond theory to build, experiment, and share working code.
*   **Community Learning:** Documenting the process to help others who are also starting—or restarting—their AI/ML journeys.
